# Far-field

At the end of the near-field stage, a far-field motion takes place. Here, oil parcels move independently under 3D advection-diffusion driven by ocean currents. Another consistent characteristic is the vertical rising induced by oil buoyancy, which strongly depends on particle sizeâ€”larger particles have greater buoyancy compared to smaller ones.

This project uses [OceanParcels](https://oceanparcels.org/), an open-source framework for Lagrangian ocean analysis. OceanParcels is developed and maintained by the OceanParcels team, and its source code is available at [github.com/OceanParcels/parcels](https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels).


### Create parcels environment

    conda env create -n parcels environment.yml

### Preconfiguration of oil parcels

A representative sample of oil particles is here created. Given release and ambient conditions, a likely parcel-size distribution is built (on a log-normal assumption) and size-corresponding buoyant velocity is calculated from a drag-buoyancy balance _(Zheng and Yapa, 2000)_.

Just insert the initial conditions in _Init.yaml_ :
- oil density
- nozzle diameter
- release vertical velocity
- number of numerical oil 'parcels' 

and run _WbuoySize.ipynb_ to obtain PDF of oil parcels size and respective vertical buoyant velocity.

A typical size-PDF is

with vertical buoyant velocity

### Transport experiment

In _Init.yaml_ are also the settings for the transport experiment:

- initial lat and lon (from near-field end state)
- near-field plume dimension and intrusive depth (end of near-field)
- starting spill date and time (with respect to first available ocean data)
- total transport time (in hours)
- output time-interval for post-processing and visualization


Run _FarParcels.ipynb_ to do the following:

1 - Define output folder & select 3D ocean currents data ( on native C grid ) from a local directory, which defines a FieldSet, together with the sub-grid diffusion constants Kv and Kh

2 - Determine surface and boundary conditions

3 - Initialize the oil parcels (in number and position), assign each particle a buoyant velocity (depending on size PDF). Define a ParticleSet from the inherited class BuoyParticle

4 - Set simulation time periods and output intervals 

5 - RUN the transport simulation


### Visualization

Running _Visuals.ipynb_ you can see the particle transport in time from two perspectives:

- a Lat-Lon view with u-v intensity field, where parcels color represent depth
